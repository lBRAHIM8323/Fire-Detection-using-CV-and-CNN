# Fire Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Description
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images into two categories: "Fire" and "No Fire". The primary goal is to create an early warning system for fire detection, leveraging deep learning techniques for accurate image classification.

## Project Overview

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
  - Collected and preprocessed a dataset of fire and non-fire images.
  - Resized images to 224x224 pixels to ensure consistency.
  - Organized the dataset into two categories: "Fire" and "No Fire", and labeled them accordingly.

- **Model Building**:
  - Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to design and implement a CNN model.
  - Trained the model on the preprocessed images to differentiate accurately between fire and non-fire scenarios.

- **Data Splitting**:
  - Applied the `train_test_split` function from Scikit-learn to divide the dataset into training and testing sets, using a 70-30 split to evaluate model performance.

- **Outcome**:
  - Successfully developed a model capable of detecting fire in images.
  - Achieved satisfactory accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the modelâ€™s potential for real-world applications in safety and surveillance systems.
